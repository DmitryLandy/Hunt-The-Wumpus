INTRODUCTION:  THE WUMPUS IS A CREATURE THAT LIVES IN A CAVE THAT HAS 20 ROOMS,
               AND EACH ROOM IS CONNECTED TO THREE OTHER ROOMS VIA A TUNNEL.  
               THE PLAYER MUST MOVE THROUGH THE CAVE AND ATTEMPT TO SHOOT THE 
               WUMPUS WHILE AVOIDING HAZARDS.
	

HAZARDS:
	       BOTTOMLESS PITS 
			TWO ROOMS HAVE BOTTOMLESS PITS IN THEM.
			IF YOU GO THERE, YOU RALL INTO THE PITS (& LOSE!)
	
	       SUPER BATS
			THREE OTHER ROOMS HAVE SUPER BATS.  IF YOU GO
			THERE, A BAT GRABS YOU AND TAKES YOU TO SOME OTHER ROOM
			AT RANDOM (WHICH MAY BE TROUBLESOME).
WUMPUS:
	       THE WUMPUS IS NOT BOTHERED BY HAZARDS (HE HAS SUCKER FEET AND IS 
               TOO BIG FOR A BAT TO LIFT).  USUALLY HE IS ASLEEP AND WILL 
               MOVE IF AWAKEN.  IN THIS VERSION, THE WUMPUS DOES NOT MOVE.
	

YOU:
	      EACH TURN YOU MAY MOVE OR SHOOT.
		  MOVE 
                         EACH ROOM IS CONNECTED TO 3 OTHER ROOMS VIA A TUNNEL.
		         YOU MAY ONLY MOVE ONE ROOM EACH TURN.  IF YOU MOVE 
                         INTO A ROOM WITH THE WUMPUS OR BOTTOMLESS PIT YOU 
                         ARE DEAD. IF YOU MOVE INTO A ROOM WITH A BAT, YOU WILL 
                         BE PLACED IN A RANDOM ROOM.				   
		 SHOOT 
                         YOU ARE PROVIDED AN M4 CARBINE, BUT YOU ONLY HAVE ONE 
                         BULLET.  IF YOU SHOOT THE WUMPUS, YOU WIN. IF YOU MISS, 
                         YOU LOOSE. SO CHOOSE WISELY.
